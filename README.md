*User Guide*

In the Game List Tab Bar, all the video games with an image are listed. The user can filter the games by genre and sort them according to their name, release date or rating. The user can click the game to see its details, therefore details page will open. Also, there is a Segmented Control which provides the user language selection with two options: English and Turkish. On Details Page; the game name, image, developer, release date, rating and description are displayed. The main functionality on this page is the “like button” in the Navigation Bar.
